## Post-Launch Additions (2026-08-06 to 2026-08-10)
- **v1.0.1 E2E audit**: 10 functional bugs fixed (Google Sign-In, Resume Engine, Jobs, Prep Studio, Assistant fallback).
- **On-device Gemma**: `DeviceCapabilityProvider` gate, confirmation dialog with exact size, compact model fallback, `GemmaModelDownloadWorker` (resumable, Range-resume, WorkManager).
- **Offline AI fallback**: `GetAssistantResponseUseCase` → cloud → on-device Gemma → Copilot.
- **Claude provider**: added to `ProviderRefreshWorker`, `GetAvailableModelsUseCase`, `AiSettingsViewModel`.
- **Full i18n + Hindi**: all 12 feature modules extracted to string resources; `values-hi/` complete.
- **Feature interlinking**: Saved Jobs → Resume Engine / Tracker / Assistant with `AssistantJobContext`.
- **Analytics self-heal**: `AnalyticsRepositoryImpl.getSnapshots()` Mutex-guarded baseline guarantee.
- **Security audit**: 20/20 `security_scan.py` checks pass; weekly pin-drift CI workflow live.
- **T-03 provider factory path**: typed `ProviderFactory.createProvider(ProviderConfiguration)` SDK path; `adzuna`/`usajobs` factory bindings registered; Provider Management renders metadata-driven credential fields with secret/settings routing.
- **AI job-fit scoring (R-04)**: `ScoreJobFitUseCase` (batched, cached, fence-tolerant LLM scoring vs the user profile) merged with the rule-based `JobFitScorer` fallback; discovery cards show AI-upgraded fit badges and a "Best match" sort chip.
- **JSON Resume interop (R-03)**: `JsonResumeConverter` moved into `core:domain`; `ExportResumeUseCase` JSON export now emits the standard JSON Resume schema (previously truncated ad-hoc JSON) and round-trips back through the importer; import/export UI in the Resume Engine; round-trip unit tests.
- **Remote-company catalog (R-02)**: bundled snapshot of 882 remote-friendly companies (remoteintech/remote-jobs, ISC) served as a `core:data` asset; discovery filters by remote policy + tech stack (`CompanyCatalog.accepts`); company detail enriched with policy/size/region/tech/careers; `refresh_company_catalog.py` regenerates the snapshot.
- **STAR prep packs (R-05)**: `GenerateStarPackUseCase` (streaming AI via `AiRepository`, template fallback in `core:domain`) + `persistPackQuestions` so pack answers record against real session rows; Prep Studio Practice tab generates and practices role-specific STAR packs.
- **Remote-work resources hub (R-06)**: `RemoteResourcesScreen` reachable via `Destination.Resources` from About + Profile System tab; categorized links (boards, curated lists, prep, remote companies) with localized chrome.
- **Apply-assist rules (R-07)**: job-filter include/exclude keyword chips (whitelist/blacklist) + Tracker daily application quota (count vs. configurable DataStore-backed cap) — UX patterns reimplemented from scratch.

## Phase 12 Completion
- **Design System**: Tokenized color/type/spacing/shape/elevation/motion with Light/Dark/AMOLED/Dynamic themes.
- **Component Library**: `:core:designsystem` catalog — see `COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md`.
- **Redesigned**: Dashboard (Command Center), Assistant (OS-style streaming), Analytics (interactive charts), Tracker (Kanban + drag-and-drop), Profile (sectioned hub), Jobs, Resume, Interview (mock data removed), Recruiter.
- **Contracts Frozen**: Design system, components, navigation, theme, motion — see `PHASE_12_REPORT.artifact.md`.

## Phase 13 Completion (Quality Engineering & Release Candidate)
- **Stale-test repair**: 20+ stale test files repaired across 9 modules (`core:domain`, `core:data`, `app`, tracker, profile, resume, jobs) against current contracts (deleted use cases removed, direct `CoreResult` stubs, Main-scheduler-safe tests).
- **App-module fixes**: WorkManager companion mocking (`mockkObject`), ConnectivityMonitor `getSystemService` stubbing, `Result.success()` equality assertions, `emptyFlow` determinism.
- **Verification**: full project `testDebugUnitTest` green; `assembleDebug` green.

## Phase 14 Completion (Production Launch & Operations)
- **Release build**: signing config (env-var secrets + `keystore.jks`), R8 minify + shrink, ProGuard mapping, native symbols, v1.0.0.
- **CI/CD**: 10-job pipeline (quick-check, quality, unit matrix, emulator tests, coverage, security scan, release build, benchmarks, Play upload, notify).
- **Monitoring**: `CrashReporter`, KPI targets, privacy-safe telemetry.
- **Docs finalized**: `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `LICENSE`, `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`, `SECURITY_GUIDE.md`, `TEST_PLAN.md`, `OBSERVABILITY_GUIDE.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, `RELEASE_GUIDE.md`, `OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md`, plus the four final reports.
- **Deliverables**: `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md`, `TECHNICAL_DEBT_REPORT.md`, `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`, `PROJECT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`.
