# Aivance

Aivance is a production-grade Android application foundation built with a multi-module Clean Architecture and a premium dark-first design system. It serves as a robust starting point for high-performance, maintainable, and scalable Android applications.

## Overview

Aivance leverages modern Android development practices to provide a seamless user experience and developer ergonomics. The project is designed with a focus on:
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns into data, domain, and UI layers.
- **Modularity**: A feature-based multi-module structure for improved build times and code isolation.
- **Premium Design**: A dark-first, Material 3-compliant design system that is both expressive and adaptive.

## Key Features

- **Resume Optimizer & ATS Matcher**: Analyze and optimize your resume to pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) with ease. Get **live-reactive scoring** — the ATS engine recalculates automatically (debounced 800 ms) whenever your resume version or job description changes, and **streams analysis progress token-by-token** so you watch the keywords light up instead of staring at a spinner.
- **AI Career Roadmap**: Generate personalized career paths based on your current skills and target roles.
- **Dynamic Cover Letter Generator**: Create tailored cover letters for every job application using advanced AI models. From any job detail screen the engine auto-generates a letter for that job (Copy / Edit / Export to PDF wired).
- **AI Interview Coach**: Practice interviews with a real-time AI coach that provides feedback on your answers and delivery.
- **Real-Time AI Career Assistant**: A context-aware assistant that streams responses token-by-token (Groq/OpenAI/Gemini/Claude SSE), routes intent-based commands (resume analysis, job search, roadmap, mock interview) to the right engine, and gracefully falls back to one-shot generation when a provider lacks streaming.
- **Universal Job Tracker / Pipeline**: Manage your entire job search funnel in one place, from discovery to offer, as a Kanban board.
- **Real Job Search & Filters**: Search across multiple providers (RemoteOK, Remotive, Apify, Arbeitnow, Jobicy, Adzuna, USAJobs) with genuine client-side filtering — **Location (Country / State / City from a ~80-country world catalog), Employment Type (Full-time, Part-time, Internship, Apprenticeship, Contract), Workplace (On-site, Remote, Hybrid), and Experience (0–15+ years)** — plus relevance-ranked results (title > company > description) instead of random provider dumps. Searches fire only when you commit the query (Enter / search button) or apply a filter, so results always match your intent.
- **Working Apply Flow**: "Apply & Track" opens the real application page via a normalized apply URL (explicit URL → `sourceUrl` → href inside the description HTML), and one tap creates an application in the Pipeline.
- **Linked Intelligence Engines**: Job detail → ATS (pre-filled with the job description), Job detail → Cover Letter (auto-generates for that job), Job detail → Recruiter Discovery, Company detail → Recruiters + open roles — every button navigates somewhere real.
- **Streaming Everywhere**: Beyond the Assistant, the **Cover Letter generator and Resume Engine optimization step now stream tokens live** with a typewriter caret — you watch the letter / improved section being written instead of staring at a spinner, with graceful fallback for non-streaming providers.
- **Career HQ Pie Chart**: The Dashboard renders an animated **career-breakdown pie chart** (Career Score · ATS Score · Applied · Saved Jobs) alongside the hero gauge and quick stats.
- **Masked Provider Keys**: Provider Management shows a **masked credential preview** (`sk-••••abcd`) next to the live health chip — the full API key is never rendered on screen.
- **About AiVance**: A new About screen with creator contact (email `iamshaikhazmathulla@outlook.com` · Instagram `@Iamazmathulla`), clickable open-source license links, and a "How AiVance is Made" tech section.
- **Fully Localized UI + Working Language Picker**: Every user-facing string across all feature modules (plus navigation and worker notifications) was extracted into `res/values*` string resources with a **complete Hindi (`values-hi`) translation**. Settings → Language (English/हिन्दी/Español/Français/Deutsch/中文/日本語) is persisted to the encrypted DataStore and applied at app startup — switching language now translates the entire app, not just system-formatted values.
- **Always-On Bottom Navigation**: The 5-tab shell stays visible across the whole main graph (including detail screens) and system back pops one screen at a time — no more accidental app exits from a random tab.
- **Pipeline Manual Add**: Add an application by hand (company + role + stage) straight from the Kanban board via the FAB.
- **Reliable Resume Parsing**: Section parsing no longer dead-ends — versions are fully hydrated with their sections and a deterministic heading-based parser guarantees usable output even without an AI provider.

## Architecture

Aivance is built upon the principles of **Clean Architecture**, ensuring a clear separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

Detailed design decisions and architectural evolutions are documented in our [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](docs/adr/).

### Core Pillars
- **Multi-module Architecture**: The project is organized into feature and core modules to promote isolation, reusability, and faster build times.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Using [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for robust and scalable dependency management.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)**: UI state management follows UDF principles using [StateFlow](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-state-flow/) and [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) to ensure predictable UI updates.

## API Setup (Gemini AI)

Some features (like AI integration) require API keys. These must be configured in your `local.properties` file or through the App Settings menu to avoid committing sensitive information.

### Configuration via `local.properties`
To use the AI features (e.g., in the `:core:network` module), you need a Gemini API key:
1. Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Create or copy your API key.
3. Open your `local.properties` file in the project root.
4. Add the following line:
   ```properties
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Configuration via App Settings
Alternatively, you can provide the API key directly within the app:
1. Open the **Aivance** app on your device.
2. Navigate to **Profile > Settings**.
3. Enter your Gemini API key in the designated field.
4. The key will be securely stored in your local DataStore.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never commit `local.properties` to version control. It is already included in the `.gitignore` by default.
